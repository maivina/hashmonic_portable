# hashmonic_portable
A portable, high-performance cybersecurity forensics and hashing suite built natively in PowerShell.

Since I am an AI, I cannot directly drop a downloadable file onto your computer. However, I can give you the exact text so you can create the file yourself in 5 seconds.

Here is exactly how to do it:

1. Open **Notepad** on your computer.
2. Click **Copy code** on the block below and paste it into Notepad.
3. Click **File** -> **Save As**.
4. Change "Save as type" from *Text Documents (*.txt)* to **All Files (*.*)**.
5. Name the file exactly **`README.md`** and save it.

You can now upload that exact file straight to GitHub!

## 🎯 Overview

**Hashmonic** is a professional-grade file forensics and integrity monitoring tool. Designed for penetration testers, sysadmins, and power users, it provides deep Windows file system integration without the need for third-party `C#` compilers or heavy installations.

Whether you need to generate cryptographic intelligence briefs, monitor memory-level file modifications in real-time, or cross-reference massive directory structures byte-for-byte, Hashmonic executes with unbreakable error handling and zero ghost processes.

> **Note:** Watch the tool dynamically swap algorithms, deep-scan directories, and output real-time surveillance events.

## ✨ Advanced Features

* 🔐 **Dynamic Cryptographic Engine:** Instantly swap between `MD5`, `SHA1`, `SHA256` (Default), `SHA384`, and `SHA512` algorithms on the fly.
* 🔍 **Deep Forensic Directory Scanning:** Bypasses locked files and ignores Windows junction loops (`ReparsePoints`). Accurately calculates exact byte-for-byte sizes matching Windows Explorer.
* 📊 **Cross-Reference Directory Comparison:** Compares entire directory trees to find matching hashes, security mismatches, and missing files, generating a full statistical breakdown.
* 📡 **Live Surveillance Dashboard:** A real-time memory monitor that tracks file system events without creating massive log files. Detects:
* File/Folder Creation, Deletion, and Renaming.
* Content Modifications.
* Security Attribute Changes (e.g., when a file is locked to `ReadOnly` or hidden).


* 📑 **Intelligence Reporting:** Automatically generates beautifully formatted `.txt` forensic briefs saved directly to an internal `\Reports` directory.
* 🔊 **Asynchronous Audio Engine:** Runs custom console beeps on a separate background thread, providing instant auditory feedback without freezing the UI.

## 📂 The Portable Architecture

Hashmonic is designed to be **100% self-healing and portable**. You can place the application folder on a USB drive, move it across different networks, or shift it between drives.

Instead of manually editing Windows shortcut targets, the included `Fix_Shortcut_Path.bat` automatically analyzes its current location, repairs the `Launch Tool.lnk` binary, forces Administrator privileges, and preserves your custom console aesthetics (transparency/colors).

---

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

1. **Download the Suite:** Click the green `Code` button at the top of this repository and select **Download ZIP**. Extract the folder anywhere on your computer.
2. **Initialize Auto-Repair:** Double-click `Fix_Shortcut_Path.bat`. This will sync the shortcut to your current directory and launch the tool safely.
3. **Standard Launch:** For future use, simply double-click the `Launch Tool.lnk` shortcut.

*(Note: If prompted by Windows Execution Policies, you may need to open PowerShell as Admin and run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` once).*

## 🖥️ Interface Modules

| Module ID | Module Name | Forensic Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **[ 1 ]** | **Single File Forensics** | Drag & drop an artifact to extract metadata, exact byte size, and generate a cryptographic signature. |
| **[ 2 ]** | **Comparison Engine** | Drag two files to instantly verify if their contents are cryptographically identical. |
| **[ 3 ]** | **Scan Directory** | Perform a deep integrity scan on an entire folder tree and map all hashes down to the exact byte. |
| **[ 4 ]** | **Comparison Directory** | Cross-reference two directories to detect modifications and missing source/target files. |
| **[ 5 ]** | **Text / String Hasher** | Type any string to instantly generate a cipher result and formatted character count. |
